# Detecting_COVID_19_in_X_ray_Images_using_tensorflow_and_keras
This project develops a deep learning model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using TensorFlow and Keras. Employing convolutional neural networks, the model classifies X-ray images into COVID-19 positive, pneumonia, and normal categories, aiding rapid and accurate diagnosis to support healthcare professionals.
